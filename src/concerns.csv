355,gpt-4-0613,hpv,VaxConcerns_2.3,the body’s natural defence mechanisms can cope with most of the HPV types without needing the vaccine
356,gpt-4-0613,mmr,VaxConcerns_2.3,"acquiring immunity from catching the virus, like measles, mumps, or rubella directly, is the best way to combat future infections"
